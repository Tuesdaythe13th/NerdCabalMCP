Save reference to original: orig = socket.connect\n  2. Define new function: blocked() \u2192 Raises error\n  3. Replace it: socket.connect = blocked\n  4. Now all code uses our version!\n  \nTo restore:\n  socket.connect = orig\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Limitations\n\nThis is a **teaching demo**. In production, you'd also need:\n\n1. **Docker network isolation:** `--network none`\n2. **OS firewall rules:** `iptables` or `ufw`\n3. **Process sandboxing:** `seccomp` or `AppArmor`\n4. **File system permissions:** Block write to network paths\n\n**Multi-layer security is always better than single-layer!**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc4 Research Background\n\n1. **\"Defense in Depth for Personal Computing\"** (2024)\n   - [IEEE Security & Privacy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)\n   - Multi-layer security strategies\n\n2. **\"Monkeypatching for Security\"** (2023)\n   - [USENIX Security Symposium](https://www.usenix.org/)\n   - Runtime code modification techniques\n\n3. **\"Air-Gapped AI: The Future of Privacy\"** (2025)\n   - [arXiv:2501.00002](https://arxiv.org//)\n   - Network-isolated AI architectures\n\n---\n\n## \u23f1\ufe0f Estimated Time: 3 minutes\n\n**What to expect:**\n1.

        "3. DEFENSE IN DEPTH (Multiple Layers)\n",
        "   \u251c\u2500 Firewall at application level (tool name blocking)\n",
