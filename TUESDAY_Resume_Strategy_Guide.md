## 🎯 How to Position Your Unique Background

### Your Superpower: "The Clinical Diagnostician"

**Core narrative:** "I apply biological and cognitive failure models to AI safety—developing what I call the 'DSM for AI Systems.'"

This frames your approach as:
- **Novel** (clinical diagnostics is underexplored in AI safety)
- **Rigorous** (medical/clinical frameworks are well-established)
- **Practical** (diagnostic frameworks are actionable)
- **Differentiated** (most ML researchers don't think this way)

### The Hospitality→AI Safety Pivot Story

**Don't hide it. Own it. Here's how:**

**Bad framing:**
"I used to work in hospitality, but now I do AI safety."

**Good framing:**
"20 years producing high-stakes live events taught me to:
- Identify adversarial patterns in real-time
- Assess cascading failure risks in complex systems
- Make critical decisions under uncertainty
- Communicate technical risks to non-technical stakeholders

Now I apply these same skills to AI safety—because LLMs are live systems, adversarial actors are real, and failure cascades matter."

**Key insight:** Your hospitality background is *relevant*, not tangential. Position it as **applied complex systems security**.

## 🧠 Strategic Positioning Advice

### 1. The "AI Psychosis" Research

**This is GOLD.** Position it as:
- Novel theoretical framework
- Mechanistic interpretability meets clinical psychiatry
- Addresses gap in current AI safety research (most MI work focuses on capabilities, not failure modes)

**Use it to:**
- Open conversations with research labs
- Demonstrate original thinking
- Show interdisciplinary approach

**Pro tip:** Have a 1-page research summary ready to share

---

### 2. MLCommons Work

**This is your credibility anchor.** Use it to:
- Demonstrate industry impact
- Show you ship real benchmarks, not just papers
- Prove you can collaborate with top organizations

**Name-drop appropriately:**
"As co-founder of MLCommons' Agentic AI Working Group, I collaborated with teams from Google, Anthropic, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to develop..."

---

### 3. NIST AI 700-2 Contribution

**Government credibility.** Use for:
- Policy roles
- Enterprise sales (companies want NIST-aligned contractors)
- Demonstrating real-world impact beyond academia

**Frame it:**
"My red-teaming research contributed to federal AI trustworthiness guidelines (NIST AI 700-2), informing policy for responsible AI deployment across government agencies."

---

### 4. The "20 Years" Story

**Two ways to frame this:**

**Option A (Technical Roles):**
"20 years of forensic security and complex systems production provide a unique lens on AI safety—I understand adversarial behavior, failure cascades, and real-time risk mitigation at human scale."

**Option B (Leadership Roles):**
"20 years leading high-stakes operations (100+ events for Fortune 500 clients) taught me to assess risk, manage crises, and communicate technical concerns to executives—skills I now apply to AI safety leadership."

**Never say:**
"I worked in hospitality for 20 years before discovering AI."

## 📊 Which Resume for Which Application?

### Use **Comprehensive Resume** (TUESDAY_Resume_AI_Safety.md) for:
- Research positions at top labs
- Roles where you're applying cold (need to tell full story)
- Opportunities where they specifically ask for detailed CV
- Academic/research-adjacent positions

### Use **2-Page Resume** (TUESDAY_Resume_2Page.md) for:

## ✍️ Cover Letter Strategy

### Always customize these sections:

1. **Opening:** Reference specific role, recent company work you admire
2. **Body paragraph 2:** Connect 2-3 of your achievements to their specific needs
3. **Why them:** Show you've done homework (read their papers, understand their mission)

### Never send generic cover letter. Minimum customization:
- 10 minutes research on company
- Identify 1-2 specific projects/papers relevant to your work
- Adjust technical depth to audience (deep for research labs, high-level for policy)

---

## 🎯 Application Priorities

### Tier 1 (Dream Roles — Maximum Effort):
- Custom cover letter (1 hour minimum)
- Comprehensive resume
- Research their recent work deeply
- Find warm intro if possible
- Prepare work sample/case study
- Follow up after applying

### Tier 2 (Strong Fit — Moderate Effort):
- Customized cover letter (30 mins)
- 2-page resume
- Skim their recent work
- Apply through standard channels
- Follow up once

### Tier 3 (Worth a Shot — Minimal Effort):
- Template cover letter with light customization (10 mins)
- 1-page executive resume
- Quick application
- No follow-up unless they respond

**Focus your energy on Tier 1 opportunities.**

## 🚀 Pro Tips

### 1. The "Research Sample" Strategy
Always have 1-2 research samples ready:
- AI Psychosis research (1-pager)
- Neural Forensic Suite (Colab notebook)
- Benchmark design case study

Offer to share in cover letter: "I'd be happy to share my research on [topic] if helpful."

### 2. The "I Read Your Paper" Opener
If applying to research lab:
"I recently read your work on [specific paper] and was particularly intrigued by [specific finding]. My research on [your work] explores a complementary angle..."

**This separates you from 95% of applicants.**

### 3. The "Warm Intro" Hack
Check LinkedIn for:
- People who worked at target company
- MLCommons connections
- Conference co-presenters
- Co-authors on collaborative work

Ask for intro or at least advice: "I'm considering applying to [role] at [company]. Based on your experience there, would you recommend it?"

### 4. The "Demonstrate Value Immediately" Approach
In cover letter, offer something:
- "I noticed your team is working on [X]. I recently developed a framework for [related Y] that might be relevant."
- "I'd be happy to share my evaluation rubric for [domain] if useful."

**Give value before asking for job.**

## 🎭 Common Objections & How to Address

### "You don't have a PhD"

**Response:**
"While I don't have a traditional PhD, my publication record (RecSys, SIGGRAPH, arXiv), contributions to NIST AI 700-2, and role as co-founder of MLCommons Agentic AI WG demonstrate research rigor and impact. I bring a unique interdisciplinary lens that complements traditional academic training."

### "Your background is non-traditional"

**Response:**
"My background is deliberately cross-disciplinary. 20 years of forensic security and complex systems production give me perspective most ML researchers lack—I understand adversarial behavior, failure cascades, and real-time risk at human scale. This informs my AI safety work in ways pure computer science can't."

### "You're self-taught in ML"

**Response:**
"I'm self-directed in ML, which has advantages: I stay current with cutting-edge research, adapt quickly to new frameworks, and learn exactly what I need for each project. My publication record and benchmark contributions demonstrate technical depth equivalent to formal training."

### "Why should we hire you over a Stanford ML PhD?"

**Response:**
"A Stanford PhD brings strong foundational theory. I bring:
1. Production experience (MLCommons benchmarks deployed at scale)
2. Cross-disciplinary perspective (clinical diagnostics meets AI safety)
3. Real-world risk assessment (20 years forensic security)
4. Track record of novel frameworks ('DSM for AI Systems')
5. Policy impact (NIST AI 700-2)

Different strengths for different needs."

## 📈 Metrics to Highlight

When possible, quantify impact:
- "Contributed to benchmark deployed by 50+ organizations"
- "Red-teaming work cited in federal guidelines used by agencies managing $X billion in AI procurement"
- "Co-founded working group with 100+ members from Google, Anthropic, Microsoft"
- "Designed evaluation framework tested on 10,000+ model outputs"
- "Produced 100+ high-stakes events with zero critical failures"

**Numbers add credibility.**
