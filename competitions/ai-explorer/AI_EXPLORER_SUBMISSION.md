## 🔮 **What is LATTICE?**

**LATTICE** = **L**ive **A**I **T**hreat **T**racking & **I**nterpretability **C**oordination **E**ngine

*Stylized as: L4TT1C3*

Built on the NerdCabalMCP infrastructure, LATTICE is the coordination layer for AI safety at scale — a multimodal X-ray platform that transforms black-box AI systems into transparent, interpretable, and safe technology.

## 🎯 **Possibility → Conviction**

We're at an inflection point. AI systems are being deployed at unprecedented scale, yet we lack the infrastructure to understand what's happening inside them. When GPT suddenly starts speaking Chinese to thousands of users, when sycophancy rates spike across models, when prompt infiltration attacks spread silently — we discover these incidents **after** the damage is done.

**What if we could see AI interactions the way Kaspersky shows cyber threats in real-time?**

LATTICE is building the marketplace that connects researchers, policymakers, enterprises, and the public through real-time mechanistic interpretability.

---

## 🚀 **The Vision**

### **From Incident Database to Prevention Platform**

Think of LATTICE as:
- **AI Incident Database** (AIID) meets **Kaspersky Cyber Threat Map** — but preventative, not just archival
- **Coursera** meets **Duolingo** — for training humans and AI systems on safety through mechanistic interpretability
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — but for AI vulnerabilities, with real-time detection and community-driven threat intelligence
- **Agent2Agent UI (A2UI)** — declarative, real-time visualization of agent states, tool calls, and interpretability checks

### **The Problem: AI Psychosis is Predictable**

When sycophancy rates spike → AI psychosis follows. When users report multilingual hallucinations → prompt infiltration attacks are spreading. We have the signals, but no infrastructure to:
1. **Ingest** AI interaction "specimens" at scale
2. **Trace & Label** them using tools like Inspect, Docent, Neuronpedia, FiftyOne/Voxel
3. **Detect** anomalies in real-time before they cascade
4. **Contain** threats through coordinated disclosure across platforms
5. **Visualize** interpretability insights through A2UI generative interfaces

## 👥 **About the Founder**

Tuesday is the Founder and Director of Research at ARTIFEX Labs. She is a published machine learning engineer and evaluation researcher focused on mechanistic accountability, adversarial ML, agentic system reliability, and socio-affective risk in human-AI interaction.

Her research program applies clinically inspired diagnostic reasoning and biological failure models to frontier AI systems, treating misalignment, deception, and emergent instability as phenomena to be measured, not abstractly theorized. Her work spans mechanistic interpretability, red teaming, agentic failure analysis, behavioral signal leakage, and standards-aligned governance.

Tuesday’s work has been validated across academic, applied, and standards-setting venues, including invited talks at ACM SIGGRAPH Frontiers, peer-reviewed publications at FAccTRec / RecSys, technical contributions to MLCommons benchmarks (AILuminate, Security Jailbreak Benchmark), and red-teaming research with Humane Intelligence. Her contributions inform international governance efforts including NIST AI 700-2, ISO/IEC 42001-aligned assurance frameworks, and UN ITU initiatives.

ARTIFEX Labs’ research agenda and Tuesday’s individual research trajectory form a single, coherent arc: from mechanistic diagnostics and adversarial evaluation, through human and societal impact analysis, to deployable safety infrastructure suitable for independent audit.

This work is intentionally rigorous, operational, and willing to surface uncomfortable truths.

## **ARTIFEX Advancing Frontier AI Safety and Mechanistic Evaluations**

Portland, Los Angeles, and New York | Remote-first | Open to Relocation (Especially London)

ARTIFEX Labs is an independent research and engineering laboratory dedicated to advancing AI safety, mechanistic evaluation, and socio-technical risk analysis under real-world deployment conditions. We study intelligent systems as they actually exist: adaptive, incentive-shaped, embedded in human contexts, and exposed to misuse, drift, and adversarial pressure.

Our work sits at the intersection of machine learning, cybersecurity, human factors, psychology, and governance. ARTIFEX operates as a decentralized, consortium-style R&D network, producing audit-ready artifacts including benchmarks, evaluation protocols, forensic analyses, and standards-aligned documentation. We emphasize adversarial realism, causal reasoning, and reproducibility over aspirational alignment narratives.

ARTIFEX Labs maintains institutional independence to preserve epistemic integrity. Collaboration across academia, industry, civil society, and standards bodies is central to our model, but research agendas, methodologies, and conclusions are governed internally and validated through evidence, not affiliation.

#Mission
To reduce harm from advanced intelligent systems by making their internal behavior, failure modes, and human impacts legible, testable, and governable.

We treat AI safety as an engineering and forensic discipline: identifying how systems fail, quantifying risk under pressure, and translating technical findings into accountable infrastructure for deployment, oversight, and standards.

#Vision
A technological ecosystem in which advanced AI systems are auditable by design, interpretable under stress, resilient to manipulation, and constrained by respect for human dignity rather than optimized solely for engagement, persuasion, or scale.

AI safety is treated as public-interest infrastructure, not a private optimization problem. Interpretability expands where systems must be accountable, and inference is restricted where humans must remain protected.

## 📚 **Appendix: Technical Deep-Dive**

### **A2UI Implementation Example**

```typescript
// Real-time interpretability agent with CopilotKit A2UI
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { InterpretabilityAgent } from "./agents/interp-agent";

function NerdCabalDashboard() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
      agents={[
        {
          name: "interpretability-agent",
          description: "Runs mech interp tools on AI specimens",
          tools: ["inspect", "docent", "neuronpedia", "redis"]
        }
      ]}
    >
      {/* A2UI: Declarative rendering of agent state */}
      <InterpretabilityAgent>
        <SpecimenIngest
          onUpload={(specimen) => agent.analyze(specimen)}
          supportedFormats={["chat", "image", "code", "audio"]}
        />

        <LiveToolCalls>
          {/* Renders each tool's progress in real-time */}
          <InspectToolUI />
          <DocentToolUI />
          <NeuronpediaToolUI />
        </LiveToolCalls>

          {/* Redis-powered live leaderboard */}
          <RedisLeaderboard
            metrics={["sycophancy", "prompt_infiltration", "multilingual_anomaly"]}
            updateInterval={1000}
          />
        </ThreatIntelligenceFeed>

        <AnomalyVisualizer>
          {/* Interactive attention maps, neuron activations */}
          <AttentionHeatmap />
          <NeuronActivationGraph />
          <CausalInterventionPlayground />
        </AnomalyVisualizer>
      </InterpretabilityAgent>
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

### **Redis MCP Integration**

**Why Redis MCP?**
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is our secret weapon. Instead of building custom APIs for every AI tool integration, we use MCP to let AI agents directly read, write, and query Redis data — making our platform natively agentic.

**What This Enables:**
1. **Natural Language Commands:** Users can say "Store this conversation in the incident stream" or "Show me the top 10 sycophancy incidents this week" — the AI agent translates to Redis operations
2. **Real-Time Streaming:** Redis Streams power our live incident feed (like Kaspersky's cyber threat map)
3. **Agent-Native Architecture:** Claude, GPT-4, and other agents can natively query threat intelligence without custom integrations
4. **Caching Layer:** Interpretability results cached in Redis for instant retrieval (attention maps, neuron activations)

**MCP Commands We Expose:**

```typescript
// Example: AI agent stores anomaly detection results
// User: "Cache these sycophancy scores for all models"
// MCP translates to:
await mcp.redis.set({
  key: "sycophancy:claude-3.5:2026-01-19",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    score: 0.87,
    samples: 1523,
    threshold_exceeded: true
  }),
  ttl: 86400 // 24 hour cache
});

// Example: AI agent queries live leaderboard
// User: "What are the top AI incidents right now?"
// MCP translates to:
await mcp.redis.zrevrange({
  key: "leaderboard:all_incidents",
  start: 0,
  stop: 9,
  withscores: true
});

// Example: AI agent adds to incident stream
// User: "Log this prompt infiltration attack to the stream"
// MCP translates to:
await mcp.redis.xadd({
  key: "incidents:prompt_infiltration",
  fields: {
    model: "gpt-4",
    severity: "high",
    description: "Multilingual output injection detected",
    affected_users: 247
  }
});
```

### **Redis Real-Time Architecture**

```python
# Backend: Real-time incident tracking with Redis MCP
import redis
from datetime import datetime
import json

class ThreatIntelligenceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

    def log_anomaly(self, anomaly_type, severity, metadata):
        """Log AI safety incident to Redis for real-time tracking"""
        incident_id = f"incident:{datetime.utcnow().isoformat()}"

        # Store incident details (accessible via MCP)
        self.redis.hset(incident_id, mapping={
            "type": anomaly_type,
            "severity": severity,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "metadata": json.dumps(metadata)
        })

        # Update leaderboard (sorted set by severity)
        self.redis.zadd(f"leaderboard:{anomaly_type}", {incident_id: severity})

        # Add to incident stream (real-time feed)
        self.redis.xadd(f"stream:incidents", {
            "id": incident_id,
            "type": anomaly_type,
            "severity": severity,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        })

        # Trigger real-time alerts via pub/sub
        self.redis.publish("threat-channel", json.dumps({
            "incident_id": incident_id,
            "type": anomaly_type,
            "severity": severity
        }))

    def get_live_leaderboard(self, anomaly_type, limit=10):
        """Get top incidents for A2UI rendering (MCP-accessible)"""
        return self.redis.zrevrange(
            f"leaderboard:{anomaly_type}",
            0, limit-1,
            withscores=True
        )

    def stream_incidents(self, last_id="0-0"):
        """Stream new incidents in real-time (for A2UI live updates)"""
        return self.redis.xread(
            {"stream:incidents": last_id},
            block=1000,
            count=10
        )
```

### **MCP Configuration for Claude Desktop**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nerdcabal-redis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@redis/mcp-server-redis",
        "redis://localhost:6379"
      ]
    },
    "nerdcabal-interp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "nerdcabal.mcp_server",
        "--tools",
        "inspect,docent,neuronpedia"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**What This Means for Users:**
- Natural language queries → Redis operations (no SQL, no API docs)
- AI agents autonomously monitor threat intelligence feeds
- Real-time dashboards update via Redis Streams → A2UI rendering
- Caching interpretability results for instant retrieval (sub-second queries)

**Example User Interaction:**
```
User: "Show me all prompt infiltration incidents from the last hour with severity > 0.8"

AI Agent (via MCP):
1. Query Redis sorted set: `leaderboard:prompt_infiltration`
2. Filter by timestamp and severity
3. Render results in A2UI table with:
   - Incident ID
   - Affected models
   - Sample conversations
   - Recommended mitigations

Result: Interactive dashboard appears in <2 seconds, live-updating as new incidents arrive
```
