## 💡 Key Highlights

**Problem:** AI incidents (sycophancy → psychosis, prompt infiltration) are invisible until too late

**Solution:** Real-time threat intelligence marketplace with:
- Specimen ingestion (chat logs, multimodal data)
- Live anomaly detection via Redis Streams
- Mechanistic interpretability tools (Inspect, Docent, Neuronpedia)
- A2UI visualization (CopilotKit)
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure

**Business Model:**
1. SaaS tiers: Free → Pro ($99/mo) → Enterprise ($2K+/mo)
2. Marketplace: 20% fee on tool usage
3. Premium alerts: $49/mo
4. API access: $0.01/query
5. Compliance: $5K/audit

**Year 1 Target:** $180K+ revenue
