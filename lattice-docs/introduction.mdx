## What is LATTICE?

**LATTICE** is the coordination layer for AI safety at scale — a multimodal X-ray platform that transforms black-box AI systems into transparent, interpretable, and safe technology.

Think of LATTICE as:
- **AI Incident Database** meets **Kaspersky Cyber Threat Map** — preventative, not just archival
- **Coursera** meets **Duolingo** for AI safety — training humans and AI on safety through mechanistic interpretability
- **MITRE ATT&CK** for AI vulnerabilities — real-time detection with community-driven threat intelligence

## The Problem

AI incidents are invisible until it's too late:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Real-Time Detection" icon="radar">
    When sycophancy rates spike or prompt infiltration attacks spread, we discover them **after** the damage is done.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Interpretability at Scale" icon="microscope">
    Tools like Inspect, Docent, and Neuronpedia exist, but there's no marketplace to run them on real incidents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Coordinated Response" icon="shield-halved">
    When vulnerabilities are discovered, there's no platform for responsible disclosure across AI companies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Public Transparency" icon="eye">
    The public, policymakers, and researchers lack visibility into what's happening inside AI systems.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Solution

LATTICE provides the infrastructure to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ingest AI Specimens">
    Upload chat logs, multimodal outputs, and agent interactions as "specimens" for analysis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detect Anomalies in Real-Time">
    Monitor sycophancy, prompt infiltration, multilingual hallucinations, and other threats with **sub-second latency**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Interpretability Tools">
    Execute mechanistic interpretability checks using Inspect, Docent, Neuronpedia, and custom tools through our marketplace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize Threats Live">
    See incidents mapped like Kaspersky Cyber Threats — real-time, global, and actionable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Responsible Disclosure">
    Coordinate vulnerability disclosures with AI companies, researchers, and policymakers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

### 🚀 Redis MCP Integration

LATTICE's **secret weapon** is the Redis MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, enabling:

- **Natural language → Database operations** (no custom APIs required)
- **Sub-second latency** for all operations
- **6 powerful use cases**:
  - 🏆 Leaderboards (Sorted Sets for incident ranking)
  - 📨 Messaging (Pub/Sub for real-time alerts)
  - ⚡ Fast-Data Ingest (Streams for 10K+ specimens/sec)
  - 💾 Caching (String/Hash for interpretability results)
  - 🔐 Auth Tokens (String with expiry for enterprise keys)
  - 🎯 Deduplication (Sets for clean analytics)

### 🎨 A2UI Generative Interface

Built on CopilotKit's Agent-to-Agent UI framework, LATTICE provides:

- **Real-time agent visualization** of interpretability tool runs
- **Declarative rendering** of complex AI states
- **Live updates** as specimens are analyzed

### 🛠️ Interpretability Marketplace

Run tools from the AI safety ecosystem:

- **UK AISI Inspect** — Eval framework for model capabilities
- **Docent** — Mechanistic interpretability for transformers
- **Neuronpedia** — Neural network feature visualization
- **FiftyOne/Voxel** — Multimodal dataset exploration

### 📊 Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sycophancy Detection" icon="face-smile-beam">
    **Problem:** High sycophancy rates predict AI psychosis.

    **Solution:** Real-time monitoring detects 40% spike → alert → containment.

    **Impact:** Prevent model degradation before deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prompt Infiltration Prevention" icon="shield-virus">
    **Problem:** GPT speaking Chinese to thousands of users.

    **Solution:** Multilingual anomaly detection → coordinated disclosure → prevention.

    **Impact:** Stop attacks in minutes, not days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enterprise Compliance" icon="file-contract">
    **Problem:** Enterprises need AI safety certifications.

    **Solution:** Run audits using LATTICE's interpretability tools → generate compliance reports.

    **Impact:** $5K/audit recurring revenue, faster enterprise adoption.
  </Accordion>
