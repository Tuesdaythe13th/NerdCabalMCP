Dear [Hiring Manager],

I am writing to express my strong interest in the [Position Title] role at [Company]. As a published AI safety researcher with contributions to NIST AI 700-2, MLCommons benchmarks, and UN AI governance frameworks, I am excited by the opportunity to advance [Company's specific mission/work].

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

My work sits at the intersection of **mechanistic interpretability, adversarial ML, and real-world risk assessment**. As co-founder of MLCommons' Agentic AI Working Group, I led development of the **Agentic Product Maturity Model** and contributed to **AILuminate v1.0** (arXiv:2404.03555) and the **Security Jailbreak Benchmark v0.5**—frameworks now used industry-wide for AI safety evaluation.

What distinguishes my approach is a **clinical diagnostic lens** informed by 20 years of forensic security and complex systems production. I developed what I call the "DSM for AI Systems"—applying biological and cognitive failure models to AI evaluation. This background allows me to:

- **Identify adversarial patterns** others miss (informed by real-world threat assessment)
- **Design evaluation frameworks** that capture nuanced failure modes
- **Communicate technical risk** to non-technical stakeholders (crisis communication experience)
- **Operate under uncertainty** with real-time decision-making (live systems production)

**Recent highlights relevant to [Company]:**

- **[Specific achievement 1]** — [How this relates to their work]
- **[Specific achievement 2]** — [How this relates to their work]
- **[Specific achievement 3]** — [How this relates to their work]

[CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION WITH:
- Their recent papers/projects you've read
- Specific research directions you find compelling
- Technical problems you'd be excited to tackle
- Why their team/mission resonates with you]

I am particularly drawn to [Company] because [specific reason—their research agenda, team composition, impact, technical approach, etc.]. I believe my combination of **technical depth, cross-disciplinary perspective, and track record of impactful contributions** would make me a valuable addition to your team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in **[specific technical areas relevant to role]** could contribute to [specific project/goal at company].

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,
TUESDAY

## THINGS TO AVOID

❌ Don't apologize for non-traditional background—position it as strength
❌ Don't oversell hospitality work—mention briefly as context for unique skills
❌ Don't use jargon without demonstrating technical depth
❌ Don't be vague about contributions—be specific about impact
✅ DO show you've done homework on their work
✅ DO demonstrate technical credibility early
✅ DO connect your unique background to their specific needs
✅ DO show enthusiasm for their mission
